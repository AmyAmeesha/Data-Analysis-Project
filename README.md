# Data-Analysis-Project
The code for this program is written in R programming language. This code cleans a collected set of data and applies regression analysis, predictive modeliing and data clustering on the collected data.

Content of various csv files are as follows:
1) initial.csv : Contains inital uncleaned data collected from various web sources.
2) cleaned.csv : Contains the cleaned data obtained by filling the empty spaces in the initial dta by means of different data cleaning processes
3) mba.csv : A sub-table of cleaned.csv that contains only those parameters on which further analysis is done. 
4) scaled.csv: Contains data scaled to a range of 1-10. 
5) Categorize.csv : The initial parameters have been categorized into 4 categories using predictive modelling.

Other details of the project are mentioned in the pdf and ppt files.
